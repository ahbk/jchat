This is what I have in mind for the test. It should in the end show me a little more about how you solve problems, how you structure your code and what you care about when developing.

I would focus on first getting it working and then refactoring the areas that bother you the most into something more elegant, but feel free to tackle the problem any way you see fit.

The use-case is very simple:
    1. User goes to the landing page where it is possible to create an account or login
    2. When logged in, the user is presented with a list of all other users in the system.
    3. When any of the users in the list is clicked, a thread of all messages between the two appears.
    4. From here the user can add a new message to the thread.
    5. When the user who was sent the message updates the thread, he/she will see the new message.
That's it, pretty simple and straightforward, no notifications or anything fancy at all.

Non functional requirements:
    * The "back-end" has to be written in Python/Django.
    * You can use any open source libraries
    * It should work in a modern browser (Chrome or Firefox)
    * Either the app has to be hosted somewhere online or you have to write some instructions on how to get it up an running on Linux (preferably in a Python virtualenv)
    * I also need to get access to all the source code, be it on Github, Bitbucket or just a tar.gz...

BONUS:
If you want to impress, feel free to put a special touch on the UI.
